# flop-fpga
3.5" 3 1/2 and 5.25" 5 1/4 fpga floppy controller.
The c++ / verilog is pesudo code and an idea.
basically just record the magnetic flux data and dump it to a file and that's it.
writing a modern 5.25" driver for each os would be the most difficult part i think.

# Why
because it's fun, plus a 5.25" fpga floppy controller would be extremely useful.
you could have a bunch of these flopfpga's connected to a floppy and have a nice archive 5.25" disks

# other devices chips
deviceside has a custom 5025 FDC 2115 chip. asic? fpga? microcontroller?
